//! `--tools '*'` grants read-only tools only, and that rule is enforced against
//! a registry this server supplies as a parameter. mecmcp's own
//! `an_empty_write_tool_registry_lets_a_wildcard_reach_a_write_tool` pins the failure mode: an empty registry turns every
//! wildcard token into a writer. So the registry is asserted by name here, not
//! by count -- a count passes a refactor that renames a tool out of it.
