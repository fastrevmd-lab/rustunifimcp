//! Test helpers for loading recorded controller responses.
//!
//! Two kinds of fixture live under `tests/fixtures/`.
//!
//! The **synthetic** set is hand-written, committed, and present in every
//! checkout. It carries documentation-range addresses, locally administered
//! MACs and zeroed coordinates, and it is what the parser, workflow and
//! change-set tests read. It exists because the recorded set cannot be
//! published: seventeen tests used to skip on a fresh clone, and CI reported
//! `ok` while never running them.
//!
//! The **recorded** sets are captured per controller version by
//! `scripts/capture-fixtures.sh`, carry real network data, and are gitignored.
//! They are what `tests/version_matrix.rs` reads, because only a real capture
//! is evidence about what a real controller version serves. A hand-written
//! fixture proves nothing about drift, which is why the matrix skips the
//! synthetic set rather than counting it as a version.
