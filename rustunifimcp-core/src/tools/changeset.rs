//! Change-set lifecycle tools.
//!
//! UniFi Network has no candidate configuration, no dry-run validation, and no
//! checkpoint to roll back to. The seven tools below implement the change-control
//! lifecycle over UniFi's immediate-write REST API as a best-effort approximation,
//! with explicit honesty about what cannot be guaranteed.

use schemars::JsonSchema;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

/// Tool descriptions for all seven change-set tools.
///
/// Written here so the honesty tests in `changeset/mod.rs` can run before the
/// handlers exist. Task 27 registers handlers against these same names.
