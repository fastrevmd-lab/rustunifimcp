//! Operational actions.
//!
//! These are commands, not configuration, so they do not go through change
//! control. Each is individually scoped and audited, and all three are in
//! [`crate::tools::WRITE_TOOLS`] -- a wildcard token reaches none of them.
//!
//! `device_action`'s `restart`, `adopt`, `upgrade`, and `port_action`, and
//! `client_action`'s `block`, `unblock`, and `reconnect` mutate a device or
//! client in a single model call, with no independent second-principal
//! review -- there is no change set to route an immediate command like
//! "restart this device" through. The dispatch layer
//! (`server::UnifiServer::gate_direct_commit`) refuses those specific actions
//! unless the server was started with `--allow-direct-commit`, and audits the
//! outcome either way via `mecmcp_audit::AuditScope`. `locate` is exempt: it
//! is self-reverting and carries no lasting effect.
//!
//! Only actions that do real work are advertised. `client_action`'s
//! `authorize` and `limit_bandwidth`, `backup_action`'s `download` and
//! `validate`, and the speed test are deliberately absent (MEC-505): they
//! were reachable through `tools/list` but only ever returned an error, and
//! the controller returns `{"meta":{"rc":"ok"}}` for commands that do not
//! exist (it validates the device or client, not the command), so a guessed
//! spelling would look like success. See `docs/PARITY-AUDIT.md` for what
//! would need to be confirmed before any of them could come back.
//!
//! `adopt`, `upgrade`, and `port_action` additionally confirm live controller
//! state for the target device -- via the private `stat/device` surface --
//! before dispatching a command, rather than trusting a caller-supplied MAC
//! blind: `adopt` refuses a device the controller does not report as pending
//! (`state != 2`) or whose reported `model` (and, if given, `serial`) does not
//! match the caller-supplied `expected_model`/`expected_serial`; `upgrade`
//! refuses a device that is not adopted, is not marked upgradable, is already
//! at the requested firmware version, or whose controller-queued
//! `upgrade_to_firmware` does not match the requested `firmware_version` (so
//! the call never installs a build the caller did not name); and
//! `port_action` refuses a device that is not adopted or whose `port_table`
//! does not report the requested `port_index` as PoE-capable. This is on top
//! of, not instead of, the direct-commit gate.
//!
//! `unifi_backup_action` deliberately does not carry `restore`. Restoring a
//! controller backup overwrites the entire configuration, which is a larger
//! blast radius than any change set this server will ever carry, so it is a
//! change-set operation instead. See `tools::changeset`.
