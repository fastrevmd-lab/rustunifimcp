//! UniFi Network transaction implementation.

//! UniFi has no candidate configuration, no dry-run validation, and no checkpoint

//! live configuration. The [`UnifiTransaction`] type declares this plainly via
//! [`Atomicity`], so shared code that renders approval prompts can say so rather
//! than offering commit-confirmed semantics the vendor cannot deliver.
