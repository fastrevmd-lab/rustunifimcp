//! Mapping a UniFi change set onto `mecmcp-changeset`'s record.
//!
//! The shared crate owns the lifecycle — the transition policy, the
//! claim-before-apply, the preview-bound approval — and it stores a change set
//! as an owner, a device, an expected fingerprint and an ordered list of
//! opaque `actions`. UniFi's change set carries two things that do not map
//! onto a field of their own: the staged mutations, and the pre-image they
//! were planned against.
//!
//! Both go into `actions`, one [`StagedAction`] per mutation.
//! [`mecmcp_changeset::ChangeSetRecord`] is `deny_unknown_fields`, so a
//! side-car field is not available; and folding the pre-image in is the better
//! answer anyway. The plan digest is computed over the actions, and the
//! approval digest binds to the plan digest, so an approval now covers the
//! pre-image the plan was built against — a state file edited to swap a
//! pre-image no longer verifies.
