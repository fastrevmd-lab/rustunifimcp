//! Per-resource-kind allowlist projection, applied before a UniFi resource
//! reaches the model.
//!
//! UniFi's read APIs do not distinguish "safe to show an operator with
//! console access" from "safe to hand to a model with no duty of
//! confidentiality" -- a WLAN's `x_passphrase`, a VPN network's `x_secret` or
//! WireGuard private key, a RADIUS profile's shared secret, and a WAN's
//! PPPoE password all travel in the same JSON object as the name, VLAN, and
//! subnet a caller actually needs. This module is the boundary that makes the
//! distinction, once, for every path that can hand a resource back as tool
//! output: `unifi_list_resources`, `unifi_get_resource`, change-set
//! pre-images and diffs, and anything else that reads a resource by
//! `ResourceKind`.
//!
//! Every kind except [`ResourceKind::FirewallPolicy`] is projected through a
//! [`FieldAllowlist`] naming exactly the fields the model may see -- a
//! stronger guarantee than the denylist alone, because an allowlist drops an
//! unrecognized field rather than requiring it to be named first.
//! `FirewallPolicy` is the one shape this server deliberately keeps complete
//! (see `model::firewall`'s doc comment: a policy missing `source` or
//! `destination` cannot be used as an authoring template), so it is instead
//! run through the shared crate's denylist-and-shape scan, which redacts a
//! secret-named field in place without dropping fields nobody has named yet.
